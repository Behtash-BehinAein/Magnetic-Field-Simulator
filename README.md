# Magnetic_Field_Simulator
This tool takes an example magnetic/non-magnetic material stack and calculates the magnetic cross talk via Finite Element Method. It can also be used for finding magnetic fields for varios geometres and materials at various locations in 3D space. It is as accurate as any finite element method.
